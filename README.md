Exploratory Data Analysis with R

Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers</li>
  <li>Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots,       histograms, bar charts, and box plots</li>
  <li>Explore variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means</li>
  <li>Learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information</li>
</ul>
